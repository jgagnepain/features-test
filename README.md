# Features tests in preparation for projects

The purpose of this repo is to experiment with different solutions to problems we foresee could be encountered as we tackle other projects in the future.

## Features under consideration

### Displaying network status and speed

A few approaches are being tested:

- Displaying the native window.navigator.onLine prop as a boolean indication of whether the device is connected to the internet.
  This works and [https://caniuse.com/?search=window.navigator](is supported by most browsers).
- Displaying the navgator.connection.downlink prop as the download speed in Mb/s
  This is [https://caniuse.com/?search=navigator.connection](not supported by all browsers).
  However, on Chrome, as we throttle the connection through developer tools, we see that this dosnload speed is accurately affected and reads as the expected download speed for the connection type selected.
- Attempting to download an image of known size and tracking the amount of time the download took to calculate the download speed.
  This does not proove to be very accurate. The numbers that result from the calculation are not even close to the expected download speed value as indicated by navgator.connection.downlink. The result varies widely depending on the browser. Throttling the connection doesnt seem to have much of an effect.
  This was tested with 3 image sizes to see if there was an optimal size to chose.

Create React App information:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
